# context-economy Specification

## Purpose

The instructions that load into every session — CLAUDE.md, the WONG-STACK block, and skill frontmatter descriptions — are a shared budget. This capability bounds what each always-loaded surface may carry, so context spends on the work instead of on restatements.

## Requirements

### Requirement: The WONG-STACK block carries orientation only

The WONG-STACK block in `CLAUDE.md` SHALL carry only what an agent needs before it touches any file: what the repo's knowledge surfaces are and where each kind of fact lives, the change loop named in one line, the git-ownership boundary (the WongStack skills own all git; OpenSpec never runs git), and the rules that apply to every session regardless of surface. The block SHALL NOT restate a fact that a skill frontmatter description, a path-scoped rule, or a wiki page owns — it SHALL link to the owner instead. Every fact removed from the block SHALL have a surviving owner that loads on file touch (a rule), on invocation (a skill), or by link (a wiki page).

#### Scenario: An agent plans without touching files

- **WHEN** an agent starts a session and reads only the always-loaded context
- **THEN** it knows the four knowledge surfaces, the loop verbs, and the git-ownership boundary
- **AND** it knows where to read more before acting on any of them

#### Scenario: A fact is owned elsewhere

- **WHEN** a fact in the block is also stated by a skill description that loads every session, or by a rule or wiki page
- **THEN** the block links to that owner rather than restating it

### Requirement: The meta-repo half of CLAUDE.md is orientation only

The part of `CLAUDE.md` outside the WONG-STACK block SHALL identify the repo and point into the wiki; the conventions for working on the payload (the release ritual, template-is-code, skill authoring) SHALL live in a meta-only path-scoped rule that loads when a payload file is touched.

#### Scenario: An agent edits a payload file

- **WHEN** an agent edits a file under `.claude/skills/` or another payload surface
- **THEN** the release-ritual conventions are in its context via the meta-only rule
- **AND** a session that touches no payload file never loads them

### Requirement: WongStack-authored skill descriptions are triggers, not manuals

The frontmatter `description` of a WongStack-authored skill SHALL state what the skill does and when to invoke it, in at most 600 characters. How it operates SHALL belong in its body or its linked owner reference. A shared rule SHALL have one owner; references SHALL not reproduce the generated OpenSpec workflow layer under a new name.

The vendored `agent-browser` skill SHALL remain exempt from the description budget and SHALL remain unchanged by prose cleanup. WongStack SHALL neither install nor require generated OpenSpec skills. A target's independently owned or modified integration SHALL be preserved under the migration rules.

#### Scenario: A description is trimmed

- **WHEN** a WongStack-authored description exceeds the budget
- **THEN** it is reduced to purpose and invocation triggers
- **AND** required behavior remains in its owning skill or linked reference

#### Scenario: A generated skill is left alone

- **WHEN** descriptions are shortened during migration
- **THEN** the vendored browser skill and a target's custom integration content are left intact

#### Scenario: A generated skill is hidden from the menu

- **WHEN** migration encounters known unmodified generated content with the former visibility patch
- **THEN** it recognizes the patch as part of the old integration and retires that file under the migration rules
- **AND** it does not keep a hidden generated workflow as a normal dependency

#### Scenario: A common CLI rule is needed by two verbs

- **WHEN** two verbs need the same root-resolution or artifact-path rule
- **THEN** they link to one shared contract rather than carrying separate copies

### Requirement: Simplification reports a net instruction reduction

The completed change SHALL report before-and-after word counts for a fixed inventory of core workflow skill descriptions, bodies, and linked procedure references, including removed generated instructions and new references. The inventory SHALL show a net reduction. Counts of source text SHALL NOT be presented as measured runtime token savings. Generated review code and historical records SHALL be accounted for separately.

#### Scenario: The implementation is reviewed

- **WHEN** the simplification is reported complete
- **THEN** its evidence names the counted paths, the before-and-after totals, and the absence of normal generated-skill handoffs
- **AND** it does not claim that all inventoried text was loaded in every session
