# browser-logins Specification

## Purpose

Let the agent use the person's own web accounts through agent-browser, with each login done once and reused, kept out of preview checks.

## Requirements

### Requirement: One persistent profile keeps logins

When a task first needs a login and agent-browser has no `profile`, the agent SHALL set one to an absolute folder. It SHALL NOT change a `profile` already set.

#### Scenario: An existing config

- **WHEN** the config has other keys and no `profile`
- **THEN** the agent adds `profile` and keeps the rest

### Requirement: The person does each login once

The agent SHALL hand the browser to the person to log in, then reuse the session. It SHALL NOT ask for or store a password.

#### Scenario: A later visit

- **WHEN** a later task opens a site the person logged in to
- **THEN** no login step is needed

### Requirement: Personal browsing runs one task at a time

Browsing tasks and scheduled runs SHALL NOT share the profile at once; a task that finds it busy SHALL wait or report, never delete its lock. Preview checks SHALL NOT use the personal profile.

#### Scenario: A scheduled run during a task

- **WHEN** a scheduled run finds the profile in use
- **THEN** it reports the browser busy and leaves the lock alone

#### Scenario: A preview check

- **WHEN** `/verify` walks a preview
- **THEN** it uses a temporary profile with none of the person's logins

### Requirement: Personal browsing follows the installed tool's guide

Before a task's first agent-browser command, the agent SHALL load the guide agent-browser serves for its installed version.

#### Scenario: A first browsing task in a session

- **WHEN** a task needs the person's saved logins and has not yet loaded the guide
- **THEN** the agent loads it before opening the site
