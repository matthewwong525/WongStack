# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The README offers one prompt to paste

The README SHALL give one copyable prompt that names the WongStack GitHub repository, asks the agent to install it, and includes the raw address of `.agents/skills/wong-setup/SKILL.md` by its real path. The prompt SHALL name no target folder or folder to make first and SHALL work without a discovered setup slash command. The README SHALL send the person to an assistant that can work on their own computer as the place to paste it, with no terminal inside the chat and no cloud-container session. It SHALL name no assistant or chat app as needed: one it names SHALL come after that neutral wording, as an example or as what the maintainer uses. Where a feature works only with a named assistant or chat app today, the README SHALL say so. It SHALL say what they need first: a free GitHub account and a free Cloudflare account. Its steps SHALL end with opening the starter site and pasting its first message.

#### Scenario: A newcomer reads the README

- **WHEN** someone new to coding agents reads the install section
- **THEN** they find one prompt, an assistant of their own choosing to paste it in, and what they need first, with no step to make a folder

#### Scenario: The agent finds the runbook

- **WHEN** an agent receives only the copied prompt without a discovered setup skill
- **THEN** the message itself supplies the guide's raw address to read and follow

#### Scenario: A reader uses another assistant

- **WHEN** someone who uses neither Claude Code nor Paseo reads the install steps and the list of what they need
- **THEN** no step tells them to get either, and they can tell which features need one of them today

### Requirement: A plain walkthrough covers the whole path

The README SHALL carry the numbered install steps, and no other page SHALL repeat them. The payload's getting-started page SHALL link those steps and say what the README does not: what it costs, a numbered list of every manual step (having an assistant that can work on the computer, GitHub approval, tool installs, conditional Windows administrator approval, Cloudflare signup, the token), and what to do when something goes wrong. It SHALL NOT list a named assistant or chat app as a step. It SHALL say setup may install free tools after asking, and SHALL NOT imply a manual step is automated.

#### Scenario: Reading before starting

- **WHEN** a newcomer reads the walkthrough
- **THEN** they can tell what they must do themselves and which steps open a browser or a Windows permission prompt

#### Scenario: One copy of the steps

- **WHEN** the install steps change
- **THEN** only the README's steps need editing

### Requirement: Setup installs into an empty folder it finds or makes

`/wong-setup` SHALL install into the open folder when it is empty, or holds only a `.git` with no commits. A folder with an install record SHALL go to `/wong-sync`. Any other folder SHALL stay untouched: setup SHALL install instead into a new `wongstack` folder in the person's home folder, taking the next free numbered name when one exists with other files, and going to `/wong-sync` when one already holds WongStack. Setup SHALL make that folder without asking, only once it writes its first file, and SHALL say where it is and to open it in the person's assistant for later chats, naming no chat app. The install SHALL always take everything, with no component question.

#### Scenario: Empty folder

- **WHEN** a person runs setup in an empty folder with a Cloudflare token
- **THEN** setup installs everything there without asking which parts to take

#### Scenario: A folder with files

- **WHEN** setup runs in a folder with files and no install record
- **THEN** it writes nothing in that folder, installs into a new `wongstack` folder in the home folder, and its closing report names that folder and says to open it in their assistant next time
