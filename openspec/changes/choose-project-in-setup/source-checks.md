# Source checks

## Owner activation slice

2026-10-04: commit `8ba9ab9` on `smooth-repo-selection`, [draft change #264](https://github.com/matthewwong525/WongStack/pull/264). Integrated merged #259 baseline `c22d448`.

- App tests and coverage: PASS, [run](https://github.com/matthewwong525/WongStack/actions/runs/37215721936).
- App build/staging: PASS, [run](https://github.com/matthewwong525/WongStack/actions/runs/37215721938).
- Payload, script tests, generated hosted starter and release checks: PASS, [run](https://github.com/matthewwong525/WongStack/actions/runs/37215721956).
- No checks loosened. Corrected routing complexity without changing behavior, preserved hosted-starter transformation anchors, and indexed the new capability.
- Preview discovered through deployment readback: https://smooth-repo-selection-wongstack-staging.matthewwong525.workers.dev

Task 2.1 is complete. Source inventories 1.1/1.2 record live trust gaps; actual owner/GitHub/employee acceptance remains unchecked in 7.2. Employee enforcement, provider credentials, repository issuance and Access UI are not yet implemented/enabled.

Session fact recording was skipped: this checkout has no registered current session hook. No credential values were read or recorded for this slice.

## Current app authorization slice

2026-10-04: commit `37288ef` on `smooth-repo-selection`. Integrated merged memory-recall baseline #263 `1a7e238` alongside #259.

- App tests, coverage and quality checks: PASS, [run](https://github.com/matthewwong525/WongStack/actions/runs/37217406295).
- Build/staging: PASS, [run](https://github.com/matthewwong525/WongStack/actions/runs/37217406303).
- Script coverage, generated hosted starter and release checks: PASS, [run](https://github.com/matthewwong525/WongStack/actions/runs/37217406307).
- Two gate fixes: dependent-row cleanup in an empty-policy fixture, and a wiki reference to generated installed configuration. No schema or check was weakened.
- Preview discovered by deployment readback: https://smooth-repo-selection-wongstack-staging.matthewwong525.workers.dev

Task 2.2 is complete. Current primary reads guard described/bare dispatch and core self-identity; acknowledged grants/member removal affects subsequent requests with the same JWT. The committed runtime rollout latch remains absent; owner policy activation and provider/live acceptance are still pending. Discovery/readback is the next source task.
