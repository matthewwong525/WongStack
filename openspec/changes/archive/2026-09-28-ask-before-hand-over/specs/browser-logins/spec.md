## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The agent hands the browser over when it needs the person

When a browsing step needs the person (a login, a captcha, a code, or any other input) or the person asks to take over, the agent SHALL hand its browser over and SHALL NOT try to get past the step itself. When the person is not at the computer the agent runs on, it SHALL hand over through a private link that needs a secret key and gets a new address each time. Before it opens a link, the agent SHALL ask in the chat whether the person is ready and SHALL open the link only after they reply, unless the person's latest message asked to take over.

#### Scenario: A captcha from a phone

- **WHEN** a site shows a captcha and the person chats from another device
- **THEN** the agent sends a private link that opens its browser on that device, and the person solves it there

#### Scenario: The person asks to take over

- **WHEN** the person says to let them take over mid-task
- **THEN** the agent stops sending browser commands and sends the link

#### Scenario: The person is away when a login comes up

- **WHEN** a site asks for a login and the person has not replied for an hour
- **THEN** the agent asks in the chat whether they're ready to log in, opens no link until they reply, and the link's 10 minutes start from that reply

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The agent confirms an outward browser action in the chat

Before a browsing task publishes, sends, books, pays for, or deletes something, the agent SHALL ask the person in the chat, naming exactly what it will do, and SHALL act only on a yes. It SHALL NOT hand the browser over to get that answer.

#### Scenario: Publishing a website

- **WHEN** the agent has a website ready and the next click publishes it
- **THEN** the chat asks whether to publish it now, the question waits however long the person takes, and the agent clicks publish only after a yes
