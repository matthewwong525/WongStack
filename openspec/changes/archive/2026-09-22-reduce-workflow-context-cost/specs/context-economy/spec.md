## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Save loads conditional procedures only when applicable

The save skill SHALL expose a complete main procedure and explicit entry conditions for named-secret persistence, prose-only handling, new-plan fallback, and archived handoffs. Each applicable procedure SHALL be loaded before its actions. Unconditional credential exclusion, workflow ownership, and gate-result handling SHALL remain visible in the main procedure. Extracted procedures SHALL retain all required checks.

#### Scenario: Ordinary active change checkpoint

- **WHEN** save handles an existing active change without newly named secrets or prose-only routing
- **THEN** it can complete the checkpoint without loading the unrelated conditional procedures
- **AND** it retains record maintenance, credential exclusion, PR handling, and CI result reporting

#### Scenario: More than one condition applies

- **WHEN** an archived checkpoint also includes a newly named secret
- **THEN** it loads both applicable procedures
- **AND** preserves the secret in the required durable location and does not recreate the active change

### Requirement: Routine review authors use a focused authoring contract

Routine visual authors SHALL use the author guide and relevant examples without a required full read of the fixed viewer implementation. The builder SHALL continue to produce the standalone page from that viewer. Structural checks, rendered critique, and a revision round SHALL remain required. Specific viewer inspection SHALL remain available for a concrete question the author contract does not answer.

#### Scenario: A workflow change needs a flow visual

- **WHEN** an author creates a routine flow using documented primitives
- **THEN** the guide and relevant examples provide the required authoring inputs
- **AND** the generated page receives the existing structural and rendered checks

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Simplification reports a net instruction reduction

The completed change SHALL report before-and-after word and byte counts for a fixed inventory of core workflow skill descriptions, bodies, and linked procedure references, including removed generated instructions and new references. The inventory SHALL show a net reduction and SHALL identify shared owner documents separately. Counts of source text SHALL NOT be presented as measured runtime token savings. Generated review code, executable helpers, and historical records SHALL be accounted for separately.

The report SHALL also name required-reading inventories for ordinary active save, named-secret save, prose save, new-plan fallback, archived save, cold resume, and routine visual authoring. Ordinary save and routine authoring SHALL require less source reading than the recorded baseline. Every special-route increase SHALL be reported with its reason. Completion SHALL include behavior regression evidence and an audit that required checks remain reachable.

#### Scenario: The implementation is reviewed

- **WHEN** the simplification is reported complete
- **THEN** its evidence names the counted paths, baseline revision, before-and-after totals, and the absence of normal generated-skill handoffs
- **AND** it does not claim that all inventoried text was loaded in every session

#### Scenario: Text moves into a new reference

- **WHEN** a procedure is extracted from a skill into a new file
- **THEN** the aggregate inventory includes that file and each applicable route includes its required reading
- **AND** moving the text alone cannot count as a net instruction reduction

#### Scenario: Runtime telemetry is unavailable

- **WHEN** behavior and source-load checks pass but comparable token traces are absent
- **THEN** the change reports source-load reductions and the runtime measurement limit
- **AND** it makes no numerical claim about runtime token savings
