# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The starter app is set up to grow

The starter app SHALL route its pages through a route list, with the home page as its only page and a not-found page for every other address. Each page SHALL live in its own folder with its parts, styles, and tests; a part used by one page SHALL live in that page's folder. The Worker SHALL route `/api/` requests through a route list of handlers, one per file, starting with `GET /api/health`. An unknown API route SHALL answer 404. The scaffold SHALL ship no empty folders.

#### Scenario: An unknown address

- **WHEN** a person opens `/nothing-here` on the app
- **THEN** they see a "page not found" message with a link home, not the home page

#### Scenario: The health route

- **WHEN** a caller sends `GET /api/health`
- **THEN** the Worker answers 200 with `{ "ok": true }`, and `GET /api/nothing` answers 404

### Requirement: The code rule says where things go

The code rule SHALL load when an agent edits the main app or a mini app, and SHALL say where a new page, API route, shared part, helper, and style go, pointing at the files that already follow it.

#### Scenario: A second page

- **WHEN** the agent adds a page to the main app
- **THEN** it adds a folder under the pages folder and one entry in the route list, following the home page
