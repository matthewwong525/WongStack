## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The person saves logins through a private password link
When the person asks to save logins, the agent SHALL ask whether they are ready, then send a private link with every private link's safety: a new address and secret key each time, ending private input on successful completion, explicit closure, or after eight hours by default. The link's page SHALL be one screen that takes CSV password exports, dropped onto it or picked from the device, and logins typed or autofilled, into one list. Its primary completion action SHALL save the selected pending logins, including a valid filled login not yet added to the list, and return to the requesting task in one tap. Failed saves SHALL stay open for correction and SHALL NOT announce readiness. For an export, the person's device SHALL read the file and list its sites with none ticked; a typed login SHALL join the list ticked. Only the ticked logins SHALL leave the device. The agent SHALL learn only the names of the saved sites.

#### Scenario: An export with many sites

- **WHEN** the person picks a Chrome export of 200 logins and ticks two
- **THEN** only those two are saved, the other 198 never leave their device, and the agent names the two sites in the chat

#### Scenario: One login from a phone

- **WHEN** the person fills the page's add-a-login form from their phone's saved passwords and taps its save-and-continue action
- **THEN** that login is saved and the requesting chat is notified, and no command, log, file in the repo, or chat message holds its password

#### Scenario: An export plus a typed login

- **WHEN** the person drops an export on a laptop, ticks one site from it, adds a login for a site the export lacks, and taps its save-and-continue action once
- **THEN** both logins are saved, and the agent names both sites in the chat

### Requirement: Every private link goes through Cloudflare and closes itself
A password link, a key link, and a private form SHALL each open at a new address through Cloudflare's tunnel, with a secret key only the link carries, including when the person is at the computer the agent runs on. The agent SHALL give the person a link only once it answers from outside that computer. Each link SHALL default to an eight-hour time limit from opening and SHALL honor an explicit time override. A link SHALL stop working on successful completion, on closure, or at its time limit, even if the agent's session has ended, and a closed link SHALL never work again.

#### Scenario: The person sits at the agent's computer

- **WHEN** the person asks to save a password while at the computer the agent runs on
- **THEN** the link is a Cloudflare address, the same kind a phone would get

#### Scenario: Nobody finishes

- **WHEN** eight hours pass on a private form without a send or a close
- **THEN** the link stops working, and the agent tells the person it timed out and offers a new one
