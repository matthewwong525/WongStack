## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: CI is optional, not required

The WongStack doctrine SHALL treat GitHub Actions (and CI generally) as an optional accelerator that is honored when present and never required. The system's durable pillars SHALL be described as: pull requests, version control, OpenSpec, and everything-lives-in-the-repo.

This doctrine SHALL have **one owning file** — `wiki/development/the-change-loop.md` — which states the gate ladder (CI when present → merge, a skipped rung never being a failure), the scope of the direct-to-default-branch carve-out, and the prose allowlist (`notes/**` + `wiki/**`) with its rationale. Other payload surfaces SHALL link to that owner rather than restate it, per the `payload-single-source` capability.

Two bounded exceptions, each because the reader must act without leaving the page:

- `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` MAY carry one summarizing line per doctrine, naming and linking the owner.
- `.claude/skills/save/SKILL.md` SHALL state the allowlist's two path prefixes inline **once**, as the operational routing test the skill performs. Its other sections SHALL link to that single statement rather than repeat it.

No payload surface SHALL assert CI as the sole or required gate, state the carve-out as `notes/*.md` alone, or say that wiki edits require a pull request. No payload surface SHALL describe the staging walkthrough as a rung of the gate ladder or as a condition on the merge. Where a surface links to the owner instead of restating it, that link SHALL satisfy this requirement.

#### Scenario: Payload prose describes CI as optional

- **WHEN** a reader reviews the delivery doctrine in `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, or the `save`/`ship` skills
- **THEN** the text states CI is honored when present but not required, and names PR review as the gate when CI is absent
- **AND** no remaining sentence asserts "CI is the only gate" or "GitHub Actions is the build gate"

#### Scenario: No surface describes the walkthrough as a gate

- **WHEN** a reader reviews `wiki/development/the-change-loop.md`, the `ship` skill, or the stack section
- **THEN** no surface presents the staging walkthrough as a rung of the ladder or as a condition on the merge
- **AND** the walkthrough is described as something `/walk` produces on request

#### Scenario: The carve-out has one owner

- **WHEN** a reader reviews `CLAUDE.md`, `notes/README.md`, and the `save` and `dream` skills
- **THEN** each either links to `wiki/development/the-change-loop.md` or carries one summarizing line naming it
- **AND** no surface other than `save/SKILL.md`'s single operational statement reproduces the allowlist's scope, exceptions, or rationale

#### Scenario: The save skill can route without leaving its runbook

- **WHEN** `/save` reaches the point of deciding a save's route
- **THEN** the two path prefixes are stated inline at that point
- **AND** the skill's later sections link back to that statement rather than restating the prefixes

#### Scenario: A surface contradicts the owner

- **WHEN** any payload surface states the gate or the carve-out in terms the owning file does not
- **THEN** that is a defect, resolved by correcting the surface to a link or to the owner's terms

### Requirement: No local build fallback

The skills SHALL NOT build or test the project locally as a prerequisite for `/save` or `/ship`, whether or not CI is present. The absence of CI SHALL NOT trigger a local-verify gate. No skill SHALL run a compile, a unit-test suite, a linter, or a type-check as a condition of saving or shipping.

**The boundary is building versus exercising.** Driving a browser against an already-deployed staging environment is not a local build: nothing is compiled, nothing is installed, and the artifact under test is the one CI itself published. The opt-in staging walkthrough (`staging-walkthrough`) is therefore permitted, and is bounded by three properties that keep it from becoming a local-verify gate by another name — it SHALL run only against a deployment CI has already published, it SHALL never install a dependency, and it SHALL be absent entirely unless the repo adopted it. It SHALL NOT gate `/save` or `/ship`: it is reached only by invoking `/walk`, and its verdict conditions no merge.

The gate ladder is: **CI when present → merge.** A rung is skipped when its condition does not hold, and a skipped rung SHALL NOT be reported as a failure. Where no rung applies, PR review is the gate.

#### Scenario: No CI present does not trigger a local build

- **WHEN** a repo has no CI and `/ship` is invoked
- **THEN** the skill does not run a local build or test as a gate; it relies on PR review

#### Scenario: The walkthrough is not a local build

- **WHEN** an adopted repo runs `/walk`
- **THEN** it compiles nothing, installs nothing, and runs no unit-test suite
- **AND** it exercises the deployment CI already published rather than a locally produced artifact

#### Scenario: The walkthrough does not gate the merge

- **WHEN** an adopted repo runs `/ship` without having run `/walk`, or after a `/walk` that returned `FAILURE`
- **THEN** `/ship` merges on green CI alone
- **AND** the walk verdict is neither consulted nor reported

#### Scenario: A skipped rung is not a failure

- **WHEN** a repo has CI configured
- **THEN** `/ship` merges on green CI alone, reporting no gap
