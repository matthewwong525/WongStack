## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: CI is optional, not required

The WongStack doctrine SHALL treat GitHub Actions (and CI generally) as an optional accelerator that is honored when present and never required. The system's durable pillars SHALL be described as: pull requests, version control, OpenSpec, and everything-lives-in-the-repo.

This doctrine SHALL have **one owning file** — `wiki/development/the-change-loop.md` — which states the gate ladder (CI when present → merge, a skipped rung never being a failure), the scope of the direct-to-default-branch carve-out, and the prose allowlist (`wiki/**`) with its rationale. Other payload surfaces SHALL link to that owner rather than restate it, per the `payload-single-source` capability.

Two bounded exceptions, each because the reader must act without leaving the page:

- `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` MAY carry one summarizing line per doctrine, naming and linking the owner.
- `.claude/skills/save/SKILL.md` SHALL state the allowlist's path prefix inline **once**, as the operational routing test the skill performs. Its other sections SHALL link to that single statement rather than repeat it.

No payload surface SHALL assert CI as the sole or required gate, state `notes/**` as part of the carve-out, or say that wiki edits require a pull request. No payload surface SHALL describe the staging walkthrough as a rung of the gate ladder or as a condition on the merge. Where a surface links to the owner instead of restating it, that link SHALL satisfy this requirement.

#### Scenario: Payload prose describes CI as optional

- **WHEN** a reader reviews the delivery doctrine in `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, or the `save`/`ship` skills
- **THEN** the text states CI is honored when present but not required, and names PR review as the gate when CI is absent
- **AND** no remaining sentence asserts "CI is the only gate" or "GitHub Actions is the build gate"

#### Scenario: No surface describes the walkthrough as a gate

- **WHEN** a reader reviews `wiki/development/the-change-loop.md`, the `ship` skill, or the stack section
- **THEN** no surface presents the staging walkthrough as a rung of the ladder or as a condition on the merge
- **AND** the walkthrough is described as something `/verify` produces on request

#### Scenario: The carve-out has one owner

- **WHEN** a reader reviews `CLAUDE.md`, the memory wiki page, and the `save` skill
- **THEN** each either links to `wiki/development/the-change-loop.md` or carries one summarizing line naming it
- **AND** no surface other than `save/SKILL.md`'s single operational statement reproduces the allowlist's scope, exceptions, or rationale

#### Scenario: The save skill can route without leaving its runbook

- **WHEN** `/save` reaches the point of deciding a save's route
- **THEN** the path prefix is stated inline at that point
- **AND** the skill's later sections link back to that statement rather than restating the prefix

#### Scenario: A surface contradicts the owner

- **WHEN** any payload surface states the gate or the carve-out in terms the owning file does not
- **THEN** that is a defect, resolved by correcting the surface to a link or to the owner's terms

### Requirement: The gate is CI-when-present, else PR review

`/save` and `/ship` SHALL determine the gate by whether the repo has checks configured. When checks exist, the skills wait for them and, on failure, read-fix-repush (capped); `/ship` merges only on green. When no checks exist, the gate SHALL be PR review only — the PR plus the OpenSpec change and the in-repo record is the system, and a human approves the PR before `/ship` merges.

**Prose exception.** A `/save` whose entire diff falls inside the **prose allowlist** SHALL bypass the branch-and-PR gate and commit directly to the default branch. The allowlist is exactly one path prefix: `wiki/**`. The carve-out is decided by **path scope only** — never by file extension, and never by a judgment of how consequential the edit is. It is exact: if any path outside the allowlist appears in the diff, the normal branch + PR flow applies in full to the whole save.

Routing SHALL NOT key on file extension. Markdown outside the allowlist — `.claude/**` (the shipped payload, whose edit is a release), `openspec/**` (the specs), `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION`, `app/**`, and any config file — keeps the full gate.

The gate is not weakened by this. A wiki page is prose reviewed in the diff that produced it, and nothing in it executes, deploys, or changes what the tooling does. Session facts are not in the repository, so they need no route.

#### Scenario: Repo has CI configured

- **WHEN** `/save` or `/ship` runs and `wait-for-checks.sh` reports checks
- **THEN** the skill waits for the checks, auto-fixes on red (cap 3 attempts), and `/ship` merges only once green

#### Scenario: Repo has no CI configured

- **WHEN** `/save` or `/ship` runs and `wait-for-checks.sh` returns `NONE`
- **THEN** the skill proceeds without waiting for or requiring any CI run
- **AND** `/ship` merges on the strength of PR review rather than a green CI run

#### Scenario: Wiki-only save bypasses the gate

- **WHEN** `/save` runs and every changed path is under `wiki/`
- **THEN** it commits and pushes directly to the default branch, opening no PR and requiring no `/ship`

#### Scenario: A single non-allowlisted path restores the gate

- **WHEN** a save's diff contains `wiki/<page>.md` plus any path outside the allowlist
- **THEN** the normal branch + PR flow applies and the prose rides along on that branch

#### Scenario: Notes-only save bypasses the gate

- **WHEN** `/save` runs and its only output is facts
- **THEN** the facts go to the memory store, and no commit, PR, or `/ship` is involved

#### Scenario: A leftover notes file keeps the gate

- **WHEN** a save's diff contains a path under `notes/`
- **THEN** the normal branch + PR flow applies, because `notes/**` is not in the allowlist

#### Scenario: Markdown payload keeps the gate

- **WHEN** a save's diff touches `.claude/skills/save/SKILL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `openspec/changes/<name>/proposal.md` — markdown, but not in the allowlist
- **THEN** the normal branch + PR flow applies in full
