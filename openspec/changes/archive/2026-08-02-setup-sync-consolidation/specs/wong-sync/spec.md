# wong-sync — delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Manifest schema, lazily migrated

`.claude/.wong-stack.json` SHALL carry `version`, `commit`, `upstream { repo, fork, clone }`, and `components`. It SHALL record **install state only** — what is installed here, from where, and as of when. It SHALL NOT carry verdicts, reasons, or judgment commits; those live solely in `.claude/wong-sync-verdicts.md`, specified by the `wong-sync-adapt` capability.

The schema SHALL be stated in exactly one payload place — the `wong-sync` skill, its writer of record. `wong-setup` SHALL reference that statement for the seed manifest rather than carry its own copy, so the `components.skills` list and every other field exist once.

`commit` SHALL record the clone HEAD the repo last synced against — it is not a diff base, since nothing diffs — and SHALL drive the changelog walk.

Old manifests remain valid: missing keys are filled in during the first sync and the manifest is rewritten last, reflecting what actually happened. A manifest carrying a `capabilities` map from an earlier version SHALL have it folded into the verdict record and then dropped, per the `wong-sync-adapt` capability. `upstream.fork` SHALL remain readable where an earlier version recorded one, and SHALL NOT be written.

#### Scenario: First sync on an older manifest

- **WHEN** the manifest predates the schema (no `commit`, no `upstream`)
- **THEN** the sync completes and writes `commit`, `upstream.repo`, and `upstream.clone`

#### Scenario: Seed manifest

- **WHEN** the manifest's `version` and `commit` are null because `wong-setup` just handed off
- **THEN** the sync proceeds by the general rule (every manifest file is absent, so every one is copied) and fills in the real `version` and `commit` last

#### Scenario: Manifest carrying a stale fork URL

- **WHEN** a manifest recorded `upstream.fork` under a previous version
- **THEN** the value is preserved as-is and never used or updated

#### Scenario: Manifest carrying a capability ledger

- **WHEN** the sync runs on a manifest that still carries a `capabilities` map
- **THEN** the rewritten manifest omits that key, and the entries survive in `.claude/wong-sync-verdicts.md`

#### Scenario: The manifest is read for install state

- **WHEN** a reader or a later run opens `.claude/.wong-stack.json`
- **THEN** it answers what is installed, from where, and as of when
- **AND** it answers nothing about what was judged, which the verdict record owns

#### Scenario: One schema statement in the payload

- **WHEN** the schema gains or changes a field
- **THEN** the edit happens in the `wong-sync` skill alone
- **AND** `wong-setup` needs no matching edit, because it references rather than restates
