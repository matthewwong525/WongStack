## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Setup readies the computer before it writes anything

Before it clones the source or writes in the folder, setup SHALL ready the tools it needs, one GitHub sign-in with the `workflow` and `user:email` scopes, the git name and email, and on Windows real symbolic links, asking before each install; the person SHALL type no command. The same install question SHALL also cover the agent's browser tool and Cloudflare's tunnel tool when absent. Setup SHALL never install a package manager. A decline or failure SHALL stop setup with nothing written, except that a failed browser or tunnel install SHALL be reported and skipped, and an existing git identity SHALL stay unchanged.

#### Scenario: A new computer

- **WHEN** setup runs where tools, sign-in, and git identity are missing
- **THEN** it installs tools after asking, signs in through GitHub in the browser, and sets git identity from that account

#### Scenario: Sign-in not completed

- **WHEN** the person does not finish the GitHub approval
- **THEN** setup stops and has created no Cloudflare resource

#### Scenario: The helpers come with the one question

- **WHEN** setup runs where the browser tool and the tunnel tool are absent and the person says yes to its install question
- **THEN** both are installed, and no later step asks to install either

#### Scenario: A helper fails to install

- **WHEN** the browser tool or the tunnel tool fails to install during setup
- **THEN** setup names it, says it will be offered again at first need, and continues

### Requirement: The server script builds an agent workspace

The source SHALL ship `server/setup.sh`, which, run as root with no prompt on a fresh Ubuntu 24.04 server, SHALL create the `WORKSPACE_USER` (default `wong`), install Node.js 24, git, `gh`, OpenSpec, Paseo, the coding agents, agent-browser, and Cloudflare's tunnel tool `cloudflared`, and run Paseo as a service for that user. It SHALL NOT run `cloudflared` as a service. It SHALL be safe to run again and SHALL end by checking each promised tool, exiting non-zero and naming what is missing.

#### Scenario: A fresh server

- **WHEN** a person runs `sudo bash server/setup.sh` on a fresh server
- **THEN** it exits 0 with every promised tool installed and Paseo running

#### Scenario: A tool is missing

- **WHEN** a promised tool is absent at the end
- **THEN** the script exits non-zero and names it

#### Scenario: The check and the contract agree

- **WHEN** the script's final check and the end state in `server/README.md` name different tools
- **THEN** the source's tests fail and name the difference
