## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The walkthrough is a user-invoked verb

The staging walkthrough SHALL be reached by invoking `/verify`, or by `/ship`, which invokes `/verify` once as a non-gating evidence step between its delegated `/save` checkpoint and its merge. No other skill SHALL run it: `/save`, `/apply`, and `/continue` SHALL NOT walk, prompt to walk, or warn that a walk did not happen.

`/verify` SHALL be invocable at any point in a change's life and any number of times. Nothing in the skill SHALL limit how often it runs or treat a repeated invocation as an error. `/ship`'s invocation SHALL be an ordinary walk — same scout, same verdicts, same PR evidence — not a variant.

`/verify` SHALL ship in the payload's **core** category, so every repo receives it regardless of `components.stackPack`. It SHALL NOT be gated on the stack pack, on Cloudflare, or on any hosting provider, and no capability of the walk SHALL require an account with any vendor.

The browser tool the walk uses SHALL also be available for ordinary browser work outside the walk. `/verify` SHALL remain the only surface that produces graded merge evidence; using the browser to look at a page, fill a form, or check a rendered result SHALL NOT require invoking `/verify`.

#### Scenario: Shipping walks as evidence

- **WHEN** `/ship` runs in a repo with probe-reachable scenarios
- **THEN** `/verify` runs once after the delegated `/save` and before the merge, and its evidence lands on the PR
- **AND** a `NONE`, `UNKNOWN`, or `TIMEOUT` verdict changes nothing about the merge

#### Scenario: A repo with no stack pack receives the skill

- **WHEN** WongStack is installed or synced into a repo whose `components.stackPack` is absent or false
- **THEN** the `verify` skill is copied in with the rest of the core category
- **AND** no Cloudflare file, script, or config fragment is copied with it

#### Scenario: A repo in any language walks

- **WHEN** `/verify` runs in a repo with no `package.json`, no Node toolchain, and no vendor account
- **THEN** the walk drives its journeys and grades them normally
- **AND** nothing is added to the repository to make it possible

#### Scenario: The browser serves ordinary work

- **WHEN** a user asks to open a page or check something rendered, outside any change
- **THEN** the browser tool is available directly
- **AND** no walk is started, no journey is graded, and no PR comment is posted

#### Scenario: Walking repeatedly is normal

- **WHEN** `/verify` is invoked three times across one change
- **THEN** each invocation performs a full walk and reports its own verdict
- **AND** no invocation is refused or flagged for repetition

#### Scenario: Mid-change walking

- **WHEN** `/verify` is invoked on a branch whose `tasks.md` still has unchecked tasks
- **THEN** the walk runs against whatever is deployed for the current commit
- **AND** the incomplete state of the change is not treated as an error

### Requirement: Verdicts report, and gate nothing

The walk SHALL resolve to exactly one of five verdicts — `NONE`, `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `UNKNOWN`, `TIMEOUT` — and each SHALL be reported to the user and on the pull request. **`/verify` SHALL block, delay, or condition nothing**, because it performs no merge. Only `/ship` consults a verdict: on `FAILURE` it asks the user whether to fix or merge anyway, as `delivery-gate` defines, and the user decides.

- **NONE** — this change has no scenario any probe can reach. Report why, in one line. `NONE` SHALL NOT be used to mean "not adopted": adoption no longer exists.
- **SUCCESS** — every journey satisfied its `THEN`.
- **FAILURE** — at least one journey contradicted its `THEN`.
- **UNKNOWN** — the walk could not run or could not be trusted after any permitted heal attempt: the browser could not be obtained, the preview URL is undiscoverable, staging is unreachable, or an access block survived or could not attempt its single heal-and-retry.
- **TIMEOUT** — the walk did not finish in its budget.

When the walk lands on a Cloudflare Access challenge, the heal SHALL be gated on the observed block rather than on the repo's category. With `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` available and no service-token pair in the durable store, `/verify` SHALL heal itself once before concluding `UNKNOWN`: mint a deterministically named service token through the Cloudflare Access API (widening into the Access permission groups first if needed, under the same standing authorization), ensure the Access policy accepts it, store the pair in the primary worktree's durable `.env` per the secrets convention without printing a value, apply it as request headers on the browser session, and retry. Without that token the heal SHALL be unavailable and the verdict SHALL be `UNKNOWN`, naming the Access wall and the missing credential. There SHALL be exactly one mint-and-retry per invocation.

`UNKNOWN` SHALL NOT be reported as `NONE`. A walk that cannot run is **unverified** rather than **absent**, and the report SHALL say so in those terms: an Access challenge screenshotted and described as "a page rendered" would convert an unchecked assumption into a checked-looking one, which is the failure mode the distinction exists to prevent.

#### Scenario: A failing walk blocks nothing

- **WHEN** a walk returns `FAILURE`
- **THEN** the failure is reported and posted
- **AND** `/verify` prevents no merge, push, or other skill from running afterwards

#### Scenario: Nothing to walk

- **WHEN** the scout finds no scenario any probe can reach
- **THEN** the verdict is `NONE` and one line explains why there was nothing to walk
- **AND** the report does not describe the repo as unadopted

#### Scenario: An Access challenge heals once

- **WHEN** a walk against an Access-protected preview receives the Access login interstitial, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is available, and the durable store has no service-token pair
- **THEN** `/verify` mints the service token, applies it as request headers, and retries the walk once
- **AND** no credential value is printed or committed

#### Scenario: An Access challenge with no Cloudflare credential

- **WHEN** a walk meets an Access interstitial and no `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` is available
- **THEN** the verdict is `UNKNOWN`, naming the Access wall and the credential that would allow the heal
- **AND** the interstitial is not reported as a rendered page or a failing journey

#### Scenario: An Access challenge that survives the heal

- **WHEN** the retry after the mint still lands on the Access interstitial
- **THEN** the verdict is `UNKNOWN` rather than a passing or failing journey
- **AND** the report names the mint attempt and the surviving challenge

#### Scenario: Unverified is reported as unverified

- **WHEN** a walk cannot run because the browser could not be obtained
- **THEN** the verdict is `UNKNOWN` and the report states the walk was not verified
- **AND** it is not described as "nothing to walk"
