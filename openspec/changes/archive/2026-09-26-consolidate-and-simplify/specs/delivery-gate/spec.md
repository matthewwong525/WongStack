## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Ship delegates its checkpoint and branch gate to save

`/ship` SHALL retain its shipping-only responsibilities: verify the feature branch and default-branch state, archive the change with `openspec archive`, merge the pull request, and delete the remote branch worktree-safely. After archiving and before merging, `/ship` SHALL invoke ordinary `/save` exactly once. When no active change matches the current branch and exactly one matching archive exists, `/save` SHALL use that archive as the handoff record, SHALL NOT author a replacement active change, and SHALL own secret preservation/redaction, fact capture, commit, push, pull-request creation/update, and the CI wait/auto-fix path. `/ship` SHALL consume that result and SHALL NOT duplicate those checkpoint mechanics or require a special save flag. A mini-app pull request has no change to archive: `/ship` SHALL instead invoke `/save` once in its mini-app pull-request form, as `mini-apps` defines, and SHALL NOT walk it.

Between the delegated `/save` and the merge, `/ship` SHALL invoke `/verify` once as an evidence step. On `NONE`, `UNKNOWN`, or `TIMEOUT`, `/ship` SHALL report the verdict and merge on the save-gate result exactly as before. On `FAILURE` — after `/verify`'s own bounded fix loop is exhausted — `/ship` SHALL stop, present the evidence, and ask the user whether to fix or merge anyway; the user's answer, not the verdict, decides, and a merge-anyway is recorded in the ship report. When the walk's fix loop advanced HEAD, the fix's own delegated `/save` re-gated it, and `/ship` SHALL confirm the latest save-gate result is `SUCCESS` or `NONE` before merging.

The walk step SHALL check that the `verify` skill is present before invoking it. When the skill is absent, `/ship` SHALL report the walk as unavailable in one line and continue to the merge, consistent with the gate ladder's rule that a rung the repo lacks is skipped rather than failed. `/ship` SHALL NOT install, copy, or offer the skill to repair its absence.

Before deleting the merged branch from the remote, `/ship` SHALL find every open pull request that targets that branch as its base and retarget each to the default branch. Only then SHALL the branch be deleted, and the ship report SHALL name any pull request it retargeted. Deleting a base branch that an open pull request still targets closes that pull request, and the loss is unrecoverable: the forge will neither reopen a pull request whose base branch is gone nor retarget a closed one. `/ship` SHALL NOT rely on the forge retargeting dependents on its own, because that is a race with no completion signal. The merge, retarget, delete, and checkout sync SHALL run as one deterministic script.

When the forge deletes the head branch itself at merge, `/ship` SHALL still retarget every open pull request that targets the branch. It SHALL then check whether the remote still has the branch, and delete it only when it does. A branch that is already gone SHALL NOT be reported as an error; the ship report SHALL say that the forge deleted it at merge. When `/ship` cannot tell whether the branch exists, because the remote query itself fails, it SHALL stop and report that failure as for any other delete failure.

#### Scenario: Shipping checkpoints the archive through save

- **WHEN** `/ship` archives a completed change
- **THEN** it invokes ordinary `/save` once so the archive move, implementation and any safe example declaration land in the pushed checkpoint
- **AND** the commit tested by the resulting CI run is the commit `/ship` will merge

#### Scenario: Save recognizes the archived branch change

- **WHEN** `/save` runs for `/ship` after `openspec/changes/<name>/` moved into the archive
- **THEN** it resolves and mirrors the single archived record matching the current branch
- **AND** it does not invoke fallback planning or create a new active `openspec/changes/<name>/`

#### Scenario: Save returns a mergeable gate result

- **WHEN** the delegated save finishes with `SUCCESS` or `NONE`
- **THEN** `/ship` proceeds through the walk evidence step and, absent a walk `FAILURE`, merges without reopening the PR or waiting on the same checks itself

#### Scenario: Save returns an unmergeable result

- **WHEN** the delegated ordinary save returns `UNKNOWN`, `TIMEOUT`, or a checkpoint failure
- **THEN** `/ship` stops before merge and reports that result
- **AND** it does not bypass, repeat, or reinterpret the gate

#### Scenario: A failed ship-time walk pauses for the user

- **WHEN** the ship-time walk returns `FAILURE` with its fix attempts exhausted
- **THEN** `/ship` stops before merging, presents the evidence, and asks whether to fix or merge anyway
- **AND** merging anyway remains available and is recorded in the report

#### Scenario: An unrunnable ship-time walk never blocks

- **WHEN** the ship-time walk returns `UNKNOWN` or `TIMEOUT`
- **THEN** `/ship` reports the walk as unverified and merges on the save-gate result alone

#### Scenario: The walk skill is not present

- **WHEN** `/ship` reaches the walk step in a repo that does not have the `verify` skill
- **THEN** it reports the walk as unavailable in one line and proceeds to the merge
- **AND** it does not install, copy, or offer the skill

#### Scenario: A dependent pull request is retargeted before deletion

- **WHEN** `/ship` merges a branch that one open pull request uses as its base
- **THEN** that pull request is retargeted to the default branch before the branch is deleted
- **AND** the ship report names the retargeted pull request

#### Scenario: No dependent pull request exists

- **WHEN** `/ship` merges a branch that no open pull request targets
- **THEN** the branch is deleted directly with no retargeting step

#### Scenario: The forge already deleted the branch at merge

- **WHEN** `/ship` merges a pull request in a repository that deletes head branches on merge
- **THEN** it retargets any open pull request that still targets the branch, skips the delete, and prints no error
- **AND** the ship report says the branch was deleted at merge

#### Scenario: A mini-app pull request

- **WHEN** `/ship` merges a mini-app pull request
- **THEN** it archives nothing, runs one `/save` in its mini-app form, runs no walk, and merges on that save's result

### Requirement: The gate is CI-when-present, else PR review

`/save` and `/ship` SHALL determine the gate by whether the repo has checks configured. When checks exist, the skills wait for them and, on failure, read-fix-repush (capped); `/ship` merges only on green. When no checks exist, the gate SHALL be PR review only — the PR plus the OpenSpec change and the in-repo record is the system, and a human approves the PR before `/ship` merges.

**Prose exception.** A `/save` whose entire diff falls inside the **prose allowlist** SHALL bypass the branch-and-PR gate and commit directly to the default branch. The allowlist is exactly one path prefix: `wiki/**`. The carve-out is decided by **path scope only** — never by file extension, and never by a judgment of how consequential the edit is. It is exact: if any path outside the allowlist appears in the diff, the normal branch + PR flow applies in full to the whole save.

Routing SHALL NOT key on file extension. Markdown outside the allowlist — `.claude/**` (the shipped payload, whose edit is a release), `openspec/**` (the specs), `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `VERSION`, `app/**`, and any config file — keeps the full gate.

The gate is not weakened by this. A wiki page is prose reviewed in the diff that produced it, and nothing in it executes, deploys, or changes what the tooling does. Session facts are not in the repository, so they need no route.

A prose-only save SHALL report the changed prose paths and that they landed on the default branch, and SHALL omit the PR, CI, and preview sections rather than report them as missing. If the direct push is rejected (protected default branch, required reviews, non-fast-forward), `/save` SHALL NOT force or retry; it SHALL fall back to the normal branch + PR flow and say why.

#### Scenario: Repo has CI configured

- **WHEN** `/save` or `/ship` runs and `wait-for-checks.sh` reports checks
- **THEN** the skill waits for the checks, auto-fixes on red (cap 3 attempts), and `/ship` merges only once green

#### Scenario: Repo has no CI configured

- **WHEN** `/save` or `/ship` runs and `wait-for-checks.sh` returns `NONE`
- **THEN** the skill proceeds without waiting for or requiring any CI run
- **AND** `/ship` merges on the strength of PR review rather than a green CI run

#### Scenario: Wiki-only save bypasses the gate

- **WHEN** `/save` runs and every changed path is under `wiki/`
- **THEN** it commits and pushes directly to the default branch, opening no PR and requiring no `/ship`

#### Scenario: A single non-allowlisted path restores the gate

- **WHEN** a save's diff contains `wiki/<page>.md` plus any path outside the allowlist
- **THEN** the normal branch + PR flow applies and the prose rides along on that branch

#### Scenario: Notes-only save bypasses the gate

- **WHEN** `/save` runs and its only output is facts
- **THEN** the facts go to the memory store, and no commit, PR, or `/ship` is involved

#### Scenario: A leftover notes file keeps the gate

- **WHEN** a save's diff contains a path under `notes/`
- **THEN** the normal branch + PR flow applies, because `notes/**` is not in the allowlist

#### Scenario: Markdown payload keeps the gate

- **WHEN** a save's diff touches `.claude/skills/save/SKILL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `openspec/changes/<name>/proposal.md` — markdown, but not in the allowlist
- **THEN** the normal branch + PR flow applies in full

#### Scenario: Prose-only save reports without a PR link

- **WHEN** a prose-only save completes
- **THEN** the report names the changed prose paths and states they landed on the default branch
- **AND** it omits the PR, CI, and preview sections rather than reporting them as missing

#### Scenario: Protected default branch falls back

- **WHEN** a prose-only save's direct push to the default branch is rejected
- **THEN** `/save` cuts a branch, opens a PR whose body is the prose change, and states that the default branch is protected
- **AND** it never force-pushes
