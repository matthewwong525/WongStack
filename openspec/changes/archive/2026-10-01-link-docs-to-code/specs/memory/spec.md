## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: One lookup shows everything linked to a path or topic

Each area in the `memory` skill's area list MAY name the wiki pages and specs that own it. Given paths, a topic name, or a change, the area load SHALL print, before its facts and even when the store is unreachable: the matched areas; their named docs that exist in the repo, skipping any it lacks; up to five archived changes, newest first, those naming a given path ahead of those sharing only an area; and, for each path asked about directly, the Markdown files and lines outside archived changes that link to it, read fresh on each call and never stored. In WongStack's own repo, every capability spec SHALL be named by at least one area and every named doc SHALL exist, or its tests fail.

#### Scenario: A mini-app file

- **WHEN** the lookup is asked about `app/worker/apps/hello/index.ts`, the `mini-apps` area names `wiki/stack/mini-apps.md` and `openspec/specs/mini-apps/spec.md`, and the archived change `mini-apps-in-the-main-app` names that folder
- **THEN** it prints `mini-apps` and `worker`, both docs, that change among its past changes, the pages linking to the file, then the `mini-apps` and `worker` facts

#### Scenario: A new spec with no area

- **WHEN** a change in WongStack's own repo adds `openspec/specs/reports/spec.md` and no area names it
- **THEN** the tests fail and name that spec
