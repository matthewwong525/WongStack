# delivery-gate — delta for ship-walks-and-ci-tests

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Ship delegates its checkpoint and branch gate to save

`/ship` SHALL retain its shipping-only responsibilities: verify the feature branch and default-branch state, invoke `openspec-archive-change`, merge the pull request, and delete the remote branch worktree-safely. After archiving and before merging, `/ship` SHALL invoke ordinary `/save` exactly once. When no active change matches the current branch and exactly one matching archive exists, `/save` SHALL use that archive as the handoff record, SHALL NOT author a replacement active change, and SHALL own secret preservation/redaction, session-note capture, commit, push, pull-request creation/update, and the CI wait/auto-fix path. `/ship` SHALL consume that result and SHALL NOT duplicate those checkpoint mechanics or require a special save flag.

Between the delegated `/save` and the merge, `/ship` SHALL invoke `/walk` once as an evidence step. On `NONE`, `UNKNOWN`, or `TIMEOUT`, `/ship` SHALL report the verdict and merge on the save-gate result exactly as before. On `FAILURE` — after `/walk`'s own bounded fix loop is exhausted — `/ship` SHALL stop, present the evidence, and ask the user whether to fix or merge anyway; the user's answer, not the verdict, decides, and a merge-anyway is recorded in the ship report. When the walk's fix loop advanced HEAD, the fix's own delegated `/save` re-gated it, and `/ship` SHALL confirm the latest save-gate result is `SUCCESS` or `NONE` before merging.

#### Scenario: Shipping checkpoints the archive through save

- **WHEN** `/ship` archives a completed change
- **THEN** it invokes ordinary `/save` once so the archive move, implementation, note, and any safe example declaration land in the pushed checkpoint
- **AND** the commit tested by the resulting CI run is the commit `/ship` will merge

#### Scenario: Save recognizes the archived branch change

- **WHEN** `/save` runs for `/ship` after `openspec/changes/<name>/` moved into the archive
- **THEN** it resolves and mirrors the single archived record matching the current branch
- **AND** it does not invoke fallback planning or create a new active `openspec/changes/<name>/`

#### Scenario: Save returns a mergeable gate result

- **WHEN** the delegated save finishes with `SUCCESS` or `NONE`
- **THEN** `/ship` proceeds through the walk evidence step and, absent a walk `FAILURE`, merges without reopening the PR or waiting on the same checks itself

#### Scenario: Save returns an unmergeable result

- **WHEN** the delegated ordinary save returns `UNKNOWN`, `TIMEOUT`, or a checkpoint failure
- **THEN** `/ship` stops before merge and reports that result
- **AND** it does not bypass, repeat, or reinterpret the gate

#### Scenario: A failed ship-time walk pauses for the user

- **WHEN** the ship-time walk returns `FAILURE` with its fix attempts exhausted
- **THEN** `/ship` stops before merging, presents the evidence, and asks whether to fix or merge anyway
- **AND** merging anyway remains available and is recorded in the report

#### Scenario: An unrunnable ship-time walk never blocks

- **WHEN** the ship-time walk returns `UNKNOWN` or `TIMEOUT`
- **THEN** `/ship` reports the walk as unverified and merges on the save-gate result alone

### Requirement: No local build fallback

The skills SHALL NOT build or test the project locally as a prerequisite for `/save` or `/ship`, whether or not CI is present. The absence of CI SHALL NOT trigger a local-verify gate. No skill SHALL run a compile, a unit-test suite, a linter, or a type-check as a condition of saving or shipping. Test suites run in CI (the `ci-tests` capability), where they are ordinary checks on the existing ladder.

**The boundary is building versus exercising.** Driving a browser against an already-deployed staging environment is not a local build: nothing is compiled, nothing is installed, and the artifact under test is the one CI itself published. The opt-in staging walkthrough (`staging-walkthrough`) is therefore permitted, and is bounded by three properties that keep it from becoming a local-verify gate by another name — it SHALL run only against a deployment CI has already published, it SHALL never install a dependency, and it SHALL be absent entirely unless the repo adopted it. It is reached by invoking `/walk`, or by `/ship`'s single evidence step. Its verdict SHALL NOT function as a gate rung: an unrunnable or absent walk never blocks anything, and a walk `FAILURE` at ship time is surfaced as a user decision (fix or merge anyway) rather than consulted as a merge condition.

The gate ladder is: **CI when present → merge.** A rung is skipped when its condition does not hold, and a skipped rung SHALL NOT be reported as a failure. Where no rung applies, PR review is the gate.

#### Scenario: No CI present does not trigger a local build

- **WHEN** a repo has no CI and `/ship` is invoked
- **THEN** the skill does not run a local build or test as a gate; it relies on PR review

#### Scenario: The walkthrough is not a local build

- **WHEN** an adopted repo runs `/walk`
- **THEN** it compiles nothing, installs nothing, and runs no unit-test suite
- **AND** it exercises the deployment CI already published rather than a locally produced artifact

#### Scenario: The walk verdict is not a gate rung

- **WHEN** an adopted repo ships and the ship-time walk is `UNKNOWN`, `TIMEOUT`, or `NONE`
- **THEN** `/ship` merges on green CI (or PR review) alone
- **AND** the walk is reported, never counted as a failed check

#### Scenario: A skipped rung is not a failure

- **WHEN** a repo has CI configured
- **THEN** `/ship` merges on green CI alone, reporting no gap
