## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Ship delegates its checkpoint and branch gate to save

`/ship` SHALL retain its shipping-only responsibilities: verify the feature branch and default-branch state, invoke `openspec-archive-change`, merge the pull request, and delete the remote branch worktree-safely. After archiving and before merging, `/ship` SHALL invoke ordinary `/save` exactly once. When no active change matches the current branch and exactly one matching archive exists, `/save` SHALL use that archive as the handoff record, SHALL NOT author a replacement active change, and SHALL own secret preservation/redaction, session-note capture, commit, push, pull-request creation/update, and the CI wait/auto-fix path. `/ship` SHALL consume that result and SHALL NOT duplicate those checkpoint mechanics or require a special save flag.

Between the delegated `/save` and the merge, `/ship` SHALL invoke `/walk` once as an evidence step. On `NONE`, `UNKNOWN`, or `TIMEOUT`, `/ship` SHALL report the verdict and merge on the save-gate result exactly as before. On `FAILURE` — after `/walk`'s own bounded fix loop is exhausted — `/ship` SHALL stop, present the evidence, and ask the user whether to fix or merge anyway; the user's answer, not the verdict, decides, and a merge-anyway is recorded in the ship report. When the walk's fix loop advanced HEAD, the fix's own delegated `/save` re-gated it, and `/ship` SHALL confirm the latest save-gate result is `SUCCESS` or `NONE` before merging.

The walk step SHALL check that the `walk` skill is present before invoking it. When the skill is absent, `/ship` SHALL report the walk as unavailable in one line and continue to the merge, consistent with the gate ladder's rule that a rung the repo lacks is skipped rather than failed. `/ship` SHALL NOT install, copy, or offer the skill to repair its absence.

Before deleting the merged branch from the remote, `/ship` SHALL find every open pull request that targets that branch as its base and retarget each to the default branch. Only then SHALL the branch be deleted, and the ship report SHALL name any pull request it retargeted. Deleting a base branch that an open pull request still targets closes that pull request, and the loss is unrecoverable: the forge will neither reopen a pull request whose base branch is gone nor retarget a closed one. `/ship` SHALL NOT rely on the forge retargeting dependents on its own, because that is a race with no completion signal.

#### Scenario: Shipping checkpoints the archive through save

- **WHEN** `/ship` archives a completed change
- **THEN** it invokes ordinary `/save` once so the archive move, implementation, note, and any safe example declaration land in the pushed checkpoint
- **AND** the commit tested by the resulting CI run is the commit `/ship` will merge

#### Scenario: Save recognizes the archived branch change

- **WHEN** `/save` runs for `/ship` after `openspec/changes/<name>/` moved into the archive
- **THEN** it resolves and mirrors the single archived record matching the current branch
- **AND** it does not invoke fallback planning or create a new active `openspec/changes/<name>/`

#### Scenario: Save returns a mergeable gate result

- **WHEN** the delegated save finishes with `SUCCESS` or `NONE`
- **THEN** `/ship` proceeds through the walk evidence step and, absent a walk `FAILURE`, merges without reopening the PR or waiting on the same checks itself

#### Scenario: Save returns an unmergeable result

- **WHEN** the delegated ordinary save returns `UNKNOWN`, `TIMEOUT`, or a checkpoint failure
- **THEN** `/ship` stops before merge and reports that result
- **AND** it does not bypass, repeat, or reinterpret the gate

#### Scenario: A failed ship-time walk pauses for the user

- **WHEN** the ship-time walk returns `FAILURE` with its fix attempts exhausted
- **THEN** `/ship` stops before merging, presents the evidence, and asks whether to fix or merge anyway
- **AND** merging anyway remains available and is recorded in the report

#### Scenario: An unrunnable ship-time walk never blocks

- **WHEN** the ship-time walk returns `UNKNOWN` or `TIMEOUT`
- **THEN** `/ship` reports the walk as unverified and merges on the save-gate result alone

#### Scenario: The walk skill is not present

- **WHEN** `/ship` reaches the walk step in a repo that does not have the `walk` skill
- **THEN** it reports the walk as unavailable in one line and proceeds to the merge
- **AND** it does not install, copy, or offer the skill

#### Scenario: A dependent pull request is retargeted before deletion

- **WHEN** `/ship` merges a branch that one open pull request uses as its base
- **THEN** that pull request is retargeted to the default branch before the branch is deleted
- **AND** the ship report names the retargeted pull request

#### Scenario: No dependent pull request exists

- **WHEN** `/ship` merges a branch that no open pull request targets
- **THEN** the branch is deleted directly with no retargeting step
