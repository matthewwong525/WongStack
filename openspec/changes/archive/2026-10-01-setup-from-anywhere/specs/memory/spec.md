## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Recent chats are read through code

Memory SHALL offer a read of the person's recent chats that needs no memory store: their own typed messages from Claude Code and Codex chats on this computer over the last 30 days by default, from every folder, newest first. It SHALL leave out the agent's replies, tool output, injected instructions, background runs, and subagent chats; replace every non-empty `.env` value and known token pattern with a placeholder; and cap the total length. With no recent chats, it SHALL say so and succeed.

#### Scenario: Chats with a key in them

- **WHEN** a recent chat holds a message with a GitHub token and an agent reply
- **THEN** the read shows the person's message with a placeholder for the token, and no agent reply

#### Scenario: A computer with no chats

- **WHEN** the read runs where no Claude Code or Codex chat is newer than 30 days
- **THEN** it prints that it found no recent chats and exits successfully
