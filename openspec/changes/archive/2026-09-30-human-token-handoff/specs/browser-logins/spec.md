# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: People handle API token websites in their own browser

When a task needs a website to get, create, reveal, copy, rotate, edit permissions for, or revoke an API key or token, the agent SHALL ask the person to do that step in their own browser, providing the service's token-management link and short instructions including required permissions when relevant. It SHALL NOT use browser automation, saved logins, screenshots, page extraction, or a remote browser hand-over for that token step. A newly supplied or replacement value SHALL use the existing private key link; a change needing no new value SHALL wait for the person's confirmation. The agent SHALL resume dependent work only after the required value is saved or the person confirms completion. Ordinary website tasks, use of stored credentials, and existing authorized token management through APIs SHALL continue unchanged.

#### Scenario: A token request with a saved service login

- **WHEN** a task needs a missing API token and the agent has a saved login for the service
- **THEN** it gives the person a token-management link and steps without opening the service in its browser, receives the value through the private key link, and then resumes

#### Scenario: A token edit during an ordinary browsing task

- **WHEN** an ordinary browsing task reaches a step requiring a token permission change or revocation
- **THEN** the agent stops browser interaction for that step, gives the person the website link and instructions, waits for confirmation without taking token-page pictures or extracting its content, and resumes ordinary work afterward

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The agent hands the browser over when it needs the person

When a browsing step needs the person (a login, a captcha, a code, or any other input) or the person asks to take over, the agent SHALL hand its browser over and SHALL NOT try to get past the step itself, except that API key or token website steps SHALL follow the own-browser requirement above. When the person is not at the computer the agent runs on, it SHALL hand over through a private link that needs a secret key and gets a new address each time. Before it opens a link, the agent SHALL ask in the chat whether the person is ready and SHALL open the link only after they reply, unless the person's latest message asked to take over.

#### Scenario: A captcha from a phone

- **WHEN** a site shows a captcha and the person chats from another device
- **THEN** the agent sends a private link that opens its browser on that device, and the person solves it there

#### Scenario: The person asks to take over

- **WHEN** the person says to let them take over mid-task
- **THEN** the agent stops sending browser commands and sends the link

#### Scenario: The person is away when a login comes up

- **WHEN** a site asks for a login and the person has not replied for an hour
- **THEN** the agent asks in the chat whether they're ready to log in, opens no link until they reply, and the link's 10 minutes start from that reply
