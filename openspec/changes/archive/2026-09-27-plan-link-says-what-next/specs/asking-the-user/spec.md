## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A reply that makes or changes a plan prints its link

A reply that creates a plan, or changes what it says or its checklist, SHALL print *Click here to see the plan:* with the full link to the change's review page, as its own chat line above any closing question, never inside it. Record-keeping alone (status, branch, decision log) SHALL NOT count as a change. When the plan waits for the person, the line right under the link SHALL say *When you're ready, type `/apply` to build it.*; when the build goes on in the same run, or the plan has shipped, that line SHALL NOT appear. The closing question SHALL offer *Review the plan*; picking it SHALL end the next reply with the link line and its next-step line and no question, and SHALL start nothing. The link SHALL NOT add a stop.

#### Scenario: The person picks Review the plan

- **WHEN** a plan finishes and the person picks *Review the plan* in its closing question
- **THEN** the next reply ends with *Click here to see the plan:*, the full-path link, and *When you're ready, type `/apply` to build it.*, with no question box after it, and nothing is built

#### Scenario: Apply plans first

- **WHEN** `/apply` plans a change and goes on to build it
- **THEN** the reply prints the plan's link before the build continues, with no line telling the person to type `/apply`

#### Scenario: A save that only records progress

- **WHEN** `/save` updates only the plan's status and decision log
- **THEN** its report prints no plan link and its question offers no *Review the plan*
