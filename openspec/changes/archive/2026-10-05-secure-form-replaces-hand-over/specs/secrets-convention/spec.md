## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The person gives a key through a private key link

When a task needs a key that the live files lack, or the person asks for the key link, the agent SHALL send a private link in the same reply, without first asking whether the person is ready. The link SHALL have every private link's safety: a new address and secret key each time, one link at a time, ending private input once every asked-for key is saved, on explicit closure, or at its time limit. The page SHALL offer one field for each key the agent named, and only those, and a primary action that saves entries and returns to the requesting task in one tap. The agent SHALL name only keys already declared in `.env.example` or `app/.dev.vars.example`. A saved key SHALL go to the matching ignored live file, in the primary worktree and in a seeded branch copy, and a key the live site reads SHALL then reach both Workers. Only successful persistence of every requested key SHALL declare readiness and notify the originating workspace, with no value in that notification. Failed or partial saves SHALL preserve successes, keep missing or failed entries editable, and SHALL NOT declare readiness. The agent SHALL learn only the names of the saved keys.

#### Scenario: A task needs a missing key

- **WHEN** a task needs `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, which `app/.dev.vars.example` declares and `app/.dev.vars` lacks, and the person pastes it on the key link's page and taps its save-and-continue action
- **THEN** it lands in `app/.dev.vars`, the originating workspace is notified and pushes it to both Workers, the chat names `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, and no command, log, tracked file, or chat message holds its value

#### Scenario: An undeclared name

- **WHEN** the agent asks for a key named in neither example file
- **THEN** no link opens until the name is declared blank, with its comment, in the right example file

### Requirement: The key link waits for the person

A key link SHALL stay open for 30 minutes from when it is sent, and its page SHALL show the time left. A key link nobody has opened SHALL close at once when another private link is opened on the same computer; the agent SHALL then say the link closed and offer a new one. An opened key link SHALL keep its place: a second link SHALL NOT open until it ends.

#### Scenario: A slow sign-in at the service

- **WHEN** the person opens a key link 5 minutes after it was sent, then takes 15 minutes to sign in at the service
- **THEN** the page is still open, and the pasted key is saved

#### Scenario: A link nobody opened

- **WHEN** a key link sits unopened and another chat on the same computer needs a password link
- **THEN** the key link closes, the password link opens, and the first chat says its link closed and offers a new one
