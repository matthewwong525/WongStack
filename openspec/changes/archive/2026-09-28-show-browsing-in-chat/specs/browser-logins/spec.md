## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The agent shows its browsing in the chat

During a browsing task, the agent SHALL show the person a picture of the page in the chat at each key moment: a new page, right before an action that sends, books, or pays for something, and the result. It SHALL NOT show a picture after every action, nor repeat a page that has not changed. It SHALL keep the pictures out of the repo, and take none while the person has the browser.

#### Scenario: A booking

- **WHEN** the agent opens a booking page, fills it, and books
- **THEN** the chat shows the page, the filled form before booking, and the confirmation, each with a line saying what it shows

#### Scenario: A hand-over mid-task

- **WHEN** the agent hands the person its browser for a login
- **THEN** no picture appears until the hand-over ends
