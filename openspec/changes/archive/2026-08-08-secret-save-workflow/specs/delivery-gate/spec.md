## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Ship delegates its checkpoint and branch gate to save

`/ship` SHALL retain its shipping-only responsibilities: verify the feature branch and default-branch state, invoke `openspec-archive-change`, merge the pull request, and delete the remote branch worktree-safely. After archiving and before merging, `/ship` SHALL invoke ordinary `/save` exactly once. When no active change matches the current branch and exactly one matching archive exists, `/save` SHALL use that archive as the handoff record, SHALL NOT author a replacement active change, and SHALL own secret preservation/redaction, session-note capture, commit, push, pull-request creation/update, and the CI wait/auto-fix path. `/ship` SHALL consume that result and SHALL NOT duplicate those checkpoint mechanics or require a special save flag.

#### Scenario: Shipping checkpoints the archive through save

- **WHEN** `/ship` archives a completed change
- **THEN** it invokes ordinary `/save` once so the archive move, implementation, note, and any safe example declaration land in the pushed checkpoint
- **AND** the commit tested by the resulting CI run is the commit `/ship` will merge

#### Scenario: Save recognizes the archived branch change

- **WHEN** `/save` runs for `/ship` after `openspec/changes/<name>/` moved into the archive
- **THEN** it resolves and mirrors the single archived record matching the current branch
- **AND** it does not invoke fallback planning or create a new active `openspec/changes/<name>/`

#### Scenario: Save returns a mergeable gate result

- **WHEN** the delegated save finishes with `SUCCESS` or `NONE`
- **THEN** `/ship` proceeds to its merge step without reopening the PR or waiting on the same checks itself

#### Scenario: Save returns an unmergeable result

- **WHEN** the delegated ordinary save returns `UNKNOWN`, `TIMEOUT`, or a checkpoint failure
- **THEN** `/ship` stops before merge and reports that result
- **AND** it does not bypass, repeat, or reinterpret the gate
