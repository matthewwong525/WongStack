# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Project code is a key with one level

Access SHALL list Project code among the keys, offering Read as its only level, settable per person and per role like any key and usable with no app ticked. A person's page and a role's page SHALL offer it as one tick that says the person can install the project, off for a new person, and that tick SHALL be the same choice as Read in Keys. It SHALL count as saved when the installation holds a read-only credential for its one project, or is connected to its own repository in the employer's Cloudflare account. Ticking an app SHALL never give it. Its credential SHALL be usable for reading that one project only, and no action or mini app SHALL be handed it.

While the installation can not hand its project out, every place Project code is given SHALL name the one step left and what it is for: a read-only key where the project is kept on GitHub with none saved, or finishing Access setup where no project is recorded. The employer SHALL get the request to hand their assistant; a manager SHALL read that the step is the employer's. Giving Project code SHALL still save, and SHALL take effect once the project can be handed out.

#### Scenario: The employer gives Project code to a role

- **WHEN** the employer sets Project code to Read on a role two people hold
- **THEN** both people may install the project on their next request, and a person outside the role may not

#### Scenario: The credential is not saved yet

- **WHEN** the employer opens Keys on an installation that can not yet hand its project out
- **THEN** Project code shows as not saved with the one step left, and nobody's connection changes

#### Scenario: The employer lets a new person install the project with no key saved

- **WHEN** the employer adds a person on a GitHub installation with no read-only key and ticks that they can install the project
- **THEN** the page says a read-only GitHub key comes first and gives the request to copy, the tick saves, and the person can install the project once the key is saved with no further change in Access

#### Scenario: The project can be handed out

- **WHEN** the employer opens a person on an installation that can hand its project out
- **THEN** the tick shows with no step under it, and ticking it and saving lets that person install the project on their next request
